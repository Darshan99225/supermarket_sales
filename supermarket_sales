### **Task: Comprehensive Sales Analysis**

#### **1. Data Exploration**
- Load the dataset and inspect the structure (columns, data types, and missing values).
- Summarize key statistics for numerical columns (e.g., sales, profit, discount).

#### **2. Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing values, if any, appropriately (e.g., fill, drop).
- Check for duplicates and remove them.
- Standardize data formats (e.g., date column parsing, category standardization).

#### **3. Sales Performance Analysis**
- Calculate total sales, profit, and average discount by:
  - **Region**
  - **Category**
  - **Sub-Category**
- Identify the top 10 and bottom 10 products based on profit.

#### **4. Trend Analysis**
- Create a time-series analysis of sales:
  - Plot monthly or yearly sales and profit trends.
  - Highlight periods of high or low performance.
- Identify any seasonality in sales (e.g., spikes in specific months).

#### **5. Customer Behavior Analysis**
- Determine the customer segments contributing the most to sales.
- Analyze the impact of discounts on sales and profit (e.g., does higher discount lead to higher sales but lower profit?).

#### **6. Visualization**
- Use visualizations to communicate insights effectively:
  - Bar charts for sales and profit by category.
  - Line plots for time-series trends.
  - Heatmaps for regional sales performance.

#### **7. Insights and Recommendations**
- Summarize your findings.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving sales and profitability, e.g.:
  - Focus on high-profit regions or categories.
  - Reassess discounts for low-performing products.

#### **8. Advanced (Optional)**
- Build a simple regression model to predict future sales based on past trends.
- Use clustering techniques to segment customers or regions.
